        6️⃣ Final Verdict (Interview Answer)
        Use averagingInt when the property is int.
                Use averagingDouble when the property is double.
                Both return Double, but averagingInt is clearer and cleaner here.

            ✔ Correct

            ❌ Overkill when you just need max
            ❌ Less readable for simple cases

        If multiple employees have the same highest salary, the above may return the same salary again.
        🔹 Key Rule to Remember (Most Important)
            Use map() when your lambda returns a NORMAL value
            Use flatMap() when your lambda returns an Optional (or Stream)

        We use .get(0) because groupingBy returns a list of employees for each salary.
        Since all employees in the list share the same salary and the requirement is to fetch any one employee, the first element is selected.

            ❌ Why this is PROBLEMATIC
            1️⃣ distinct() does NOT work as you expect
            distinct() uses equals() and hashCode()
            Your Employee class does NOT override equals() and hashCode()
            So:
            Two employees with the same salary are still different objects
            distinct() does NOT remove salary duplicates
            📌 This means:
            You may still get the same salary again, not the true 2nd highest distinct salary
            2️⃣ Sorting + distinct = misleading
            Looks correct
            But logically incorrect unless equals/hashCode are salary-based
            🚫 This is a classic interview trap

        Below is correct
        Comparator<Employee> nameSort=(e1,e2)->e1.name.compareTo(e2.name);
        Better: Comparator<Employee> nameSort = Comparator.comparing(Employee::getName);

        ❌ Salary comparator — WRONG
        (int)(e1.salary - e2.getSalary());
❗      Problems:
        1️⃣ Double → int loses precision
        Example:
        salary = 20000.50 - 20000.40 = 0.10
        Casting to int gives 0, meaning the comparator returns 0 even when salaries are different.
        2️⃣ Comparator contract can break
        Returning 0 incorrectly causes sorting errors.
        ⭐ Correct version:
        ✔ Salary ascending — below both versions correct for salary
        Comparator<Employee> salarySort=Comparator.comparingDouble(e->e.salary);
        Comparator<Employee> salarySort1 = (e1, e2) -> Double.compare(e1.salary, e2.salary);

        ✅ 2. Descending Comparators

        Comparator<Employee> ageDescSort = Comparator.comparingInt(e -> e.age).reversed();
        Better: Comparator<Employee> ageDescSort = Comparator.comparingInt(Employee::getAge).reversed();
        ✔ Name descending
        Better & consistent:
        Comparator<Employee> nameDescSort = Comparator.comparing(Employee::getName).reversed();
        ✔ Salary descending
        Better:
        Comparator<Employee> salaryDescSort = Comparator.comparingDouble(Employee::getSalary).reversed();

        🏆 FINAL RECOMMENDATION (BEST WAY)
        🔥 Production-quality + Interview-ready
        ❓ Then why did I not mark #3 as “best”?
            Because #3 depends on external comparator definitions
            Comparator<Employee> ageSort;
            Comparator<Employee> nameSort;
            Comparator<Employee> salarySort;
            This creates hidden risks in real projects.
            🚨 Hidden Problems with Code 3 (Real-World)
            1️⃣ Comparator inconsistency risk
            If someone later changes:
            nameSort = Comparator.comparing(Employee::getName);
            instead of
            Comparator.comparing(Employee::getName, String.CASE_INSENSITIVE_ORDER)
            ➡ Behavior silently changes
            Code 4 is self-contained and explicit.
            2️⃣ Debugging difficulty
            When a bug appears:
            Code 3 → you must inspect 3 separate comparator definitions
            Code 4 → comparator logic is right there
            Senior devs prefer local clarity when logic is business-critical.
            3️⃣ Readability for reviewers & interviewers
            Interviewers often think like this:
            “Can I understand the full logic without scrolling?”
            ✔ Code 4 → Yes
            ❌ Code 3 → Depends on earlier code
            4️⃣ Accidental reuse risk
            Suppose someone reuses ageSort elsewhere:
            .sorted(ageSort.thenComparing(salarySort))
            Now salary order differs from Q29 logic → subtle bug.
            🟢 When Code 3 IS actually BETTER
            Now important part 👇
            Code 3 becomes the BEST choice when:
            ✔ Same comparator is used in many places
            ✔ Comparator represents a business rule
            ✔ Comparator is final & well-named

        Below is correct code.
        ✅ What is GOOD about this code
        1️⃣ Logically Correct
        ✔ Sorts by:
        Age → DESC
        Name → DESC
        Salary → DESC
        ✔ findFirst() returns the top descending record
        So output is correct.
        2️⃣ Readable & Fluent
        This style:
        Comparator.comparing(key, Comparator.reverseOrder())
        is perfectly valid and expressive.
        Many senior devs actually like this style 👍
        ⚠️ Where it is NOT the BEST
        ❌ 1️⃣ Full Sorting Is Unnecessary
        .sorted(...)
        .findFirst();
        This sorts the entire list, which is O(n log n).
        But your requirement is:
        “Find first descending record”
        ➡ Only one element is needed, not the whole order.
        ❌ 2️⃣ max() Is More Semantically Correct
        This problem is conceptually:
        “Give me the maximum employee based on (age, name, salary)”
        So this reads better:
        employeeList.stream().max(comparator)
        ❌ 3️⃣ Name Comparator Is Case-Sensitive
        Your version:
        Comparator.comparing(Employee::getName, Comparator.reverseOrder())
        ⚠️ If names differ only by case ("adam" vs "Adam"), ordering may be inconsistent.

            Salary DESC
            🔍 Why This Is NOT What You Intended
            Your intention was:
            Age DESC
            Name DESC
            Salary DESC
            But the actual result is:
            Age ASC   ❌
            Name DESC
            Salary DESC
            This is 100% per the Java Comparator contract — not opinion.
