What Is a Shallow Copy?

1-  Copies the reference of mutable objects, not the object itself.
2-  Changes in the original affect the copy and vice versa.

When to Use Shallow Copy

1-  When the object graph is simple and immutability isn't a concern.
2-  When performance is critical and deep copy is too expensive.
