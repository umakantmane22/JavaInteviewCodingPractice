What this example covers:
1-  Deep copy for:
    1.1-  Primitives
    1.2-  Immutable objects (e.g., String)
    1.3-  Mutable objects (Date, List, custom Address class)
2-  Copy constructor
3-  Cloning (optional)
4-  Preventing side effects of shared references

Summary
-   Deep copy = full independence between original and clone.
-   Avoids bugs from shared mutable state.
-   Best used with copy constructors or serialization (for nested deep cloning).
