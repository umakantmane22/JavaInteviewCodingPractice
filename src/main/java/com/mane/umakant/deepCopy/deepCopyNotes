What this example covers:
1-  Deep copy for:
    1.1-  Primitives
    1.2-  Immutable objects (e.g., String)
    1.3-  Mutable objects (Date, List, custom Address class)
2-  Copy constructor
3-  Cloning (optional)
4-  Preventing side effects of shared references

Summary
-   Deep copy = full independence between original and clone.
-   Avoids bugs from shared mutable state.
-   Best used with copy constructors or serialization (for nested deep cloning).

🔹 What Is Deep Copy?
A deep copy means creating a completely independent clone of an object along with all nested objects.
Any changes made to the copied object or its nested fields do not affect the original object.
In contrast, a shallow copy just copies references of nested objects (not their content).

🔸 Why Deep Copy?
Needed when objects contain mutable nested objects
Avoids unexpected side effects (e.g., modifying one affects the other)
Used in cloning, caching, undo operations, etc.

🔄 Deep Copy vs Shallow Copy
| Aspect            | Shallow Copy                 | Deep Copy                                |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Field Copying     | Copies object and references | Copies object **and** referenced objects |
| Nested Objects    | Still shared                 | New independent copies                   |
| Changes in Nested | Affects both                 | Doesn’t affect the other                 |
| Complexity        | Simple                       | More complex                             |
