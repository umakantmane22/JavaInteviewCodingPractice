The final keyword in Java can be applied to variables, methods, and classes, each with different effects. Here's a breakdown of all key scenarios with simple examples:

✅ 1. final Variable
A final variable cannot
 be reassigned once initialized.

b) Final Reference Variable
c) Blank Final Variable
Must be assigned exactly once, either in constructor or initializer.

d) Static Final Variable
Constant, shared across all instances.

✅ 2. final Method
Prevents overriding in subclasses.

✅ 3. final Class
Prevents inheritance.

✅ 4. final with Loop Variables
✅ 5. final Parameters
Used to prevent method parameters from being reassigned.
