Here’s a detailed breakdown of Singleton in Java with various scenarios and patterns, including thread safety, serialization, reflection protection, and enum-based Singleton (recommended):
🔹 What is Singleton?
A design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance, and provides a global access point to it.
✅ 1. Basic Singleton (Not Thread Safe)
❌ Not thread-safe. Multiple threads can create multiple instances.

✅ 2. Thread-Safe Singleton (Synchronized)
✅ Thread-safe, but synchronization causes performance hit.

✅ 3. Double-Checked Locking Singleton (Efficient and Thread-Safe)
✅ Recommended in multithreaded environments with better performance.

✅ 4. Bill Pugh Singleton (Best for Lazy Initialization)
✅ Thread-safe, lazy-loaded, and doesn't use synchronization.

✅ 5. Enum Singleton (Best Practice)
✅ Handles serialization and reflection attack safely.
✅ JVM ensures only one instance.

✅ 6. Singleton with Serialization Safe

✅ 7. Prevent Singleton from Reflection
✅ This protects from breaking singleton via reflection.
